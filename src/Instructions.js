        In the Tower of Hanoi puzzle a player attempts to move a large pile of
        disks, known as the Tower, from the leftmost peg to the rightmost on the
        puzzle board. The rules of the puzzle state that the player can only
        move one disk per turn and can never place a larger disk onto a smaller
        one at any time.
